### Execution Steps :-
**1.** Extract the downloaded project.

**2.** Open command Prompt or terminal.

**3.** Go to the project location.

**4.** Enter the below mentioned commands to compile and run the project :-  

**``./gradlew build -Psuites=staging -PtestType=Applicant -Pver=v1``**


**Clean Project** : ``./gradlew clean -Psuites=staging -PtestType=Applicant -Pver=v1``  
	
**Compile Project** : ``./gradlew build -Psuites=staging -PtestType=Applicant -Pver=v1``  
	

**On Successful compilation of the project it will download all the dependencies like (TestNG, Extent Reporting and Google API's)**
	
**Run the Project** : ``./gradlew test -Psuites=staging -PtestType=Applicant -Pver=v1``
	
     
 **-Pversion=v1** : Here v1 is the version of the api. In future if we have multiple version the we can switch to version v2 , v3 and so on.
 	
 **-Psuites=qa** : Here qa is the test suites environment. We can run our test on multiple test environments e.g. : uat, staging and production.
 	
 **-PtestType=Applicant** : Here Applicant is the name of bunch of the test of Applicant type. In case if we wants to run the test suite on single module then we can switch to modules like Interview, Requisition and so on.and if we wants to run all the modules at a time then we can use test type as "All". It will run all the test cases of all the modules.
